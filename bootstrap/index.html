                      The hippie movement was still the fashion look of late 1960s London, but this did not inspire Vivienne 
                      Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, they were more interested in rebellion and in particular 1950s clothing,
                      music and memorabilia. Vivienne began by making Teddy Boy clothes for McLaren and in 1971 
                      they opened Let it Rock at 430 Kings Road. By 1972 the designer’s interests had turned to biker clothing,
                      zips and leather.The shop was re-branded with a skull and crossbones and renamed Too Fast to Live, 
                      Too Young to Die. Westwood and McLaren began to design t-shirts with provocative messages 
                      leading to their prosecution under the obscenity laws; their reaction was to re-brand the shop once again 
                      and produce even more hard core images.

                    This collection’s refreshed melange starred a print of Daphnis and Chloe, a 1743 painting 
                    by François Boucher from the wonderful Wallace Collection that sumptuously pictures 
                    a sleeping shepherdess being ogled by a ripped shepherd. This starred across prints on shirting, 
                    T-shirts, denim, bodysuits, dresses and a frock-coatish parka, competing with clashing 
                    ginghams, stripes, herringbones, and checks. Not unlike Boucher, Westwood is a master at 
                    subverting apparent propriety to invoke the truthful and unruly; her signature 
                    brushstrokes of drunken tailoring and subversive drape were in full effect here.

                      boutique, formerly known as; Let it Rock, Sex, 
                      Seditionaries, and Too Fast to Live, Too Young to 
                      Die.It has a triumphant history of creating ‘clothes 
                      for heroes’ – dandies, rockers, punks, and pirates.
                      It reflects the history of the Worlds End boutique 
                      and is made up of carefully selected designs from 
                      the archive; from the punk collections of the ‘70s 
                      to the Worlds End of the early and mid-eighties 
                      through to today. The new clothing collection, 
                      which will be sold online and in selected 
                      Vivienne Westwood stores, reflects the history 
                      of the shop.

                      Taking the challenges faced by modern day Venice as a mirror to those of the wider world, Vivienne Westwood and her husband 
                      and design partner, Andreas Kronthaler, used their Spring / Summer 2016 Collection to promote this. The problem there is one of 
                      repair, mass tourism on cruise ships and of climate change. This campaign encouraged people to visit www.weareherevenice.org 
                      and find out more about the challenges Venice is facing and the activists who are looking for solutions.As well as Human rights, 
                      Vivienne is passionate about the environment and actively supports the charity, Cool Earth, in their efforts to save the rainforest 
                      and stop climate change, as well as supporting the Environmental Justice Foundation and Friends of the Earth- amongst others.
                      Vivienne is also an ambassador for Greenpeace and in 2013 designed their official ‘Save the Artic’ logo and in 2015 launched a 
                      global campaign to stop drilling and industrial fishing in the area. Vivienne inaugurated the 'Climate Revolution' at the 2012 L
                      ondon Paralympics closing ceremony and continues to rally charities, NGO’s and individuals to join forces and to take action 
                      against disengaged political leaders and big business.

                                Vivienne Westwood Catwalk celebrates 40 years of the designer’s catwalk collections. The book records the inimitable creations imagined by Vivienne Westwood since her first runway show in 1981, as well as those designed by her husband and long-time collaborator, Andreas Kronthaler. Complete with an introduction and collection of texts by Alexander Fury, and biographies written by the designers themselves, the book offers a rare opportunity to chart the development of a unique and independent fashion house.
                                In celebration of Vivienne Westwood’s 80th birthday, the first comprehensive overview of Vivienne Westwood’s womenswear collections will be published – an anthology since her 1981 debut to today, presented through original catwalk photography. A treasure trove of inspiration and information, the book features over 1,300 looks from over 70 collections as they originally appeared in Westwood’s iconic fashion shows, styled as the designer intended (from hair and make-up to jewellery and accessories) and worn by the world’s top models.

                                Vivienne has long been vocal about the problems of pollution and erosion associated with large cruise ships entering Venice’s historic centre via the Giudecca canal, and made the city’s environmental issues the focal point of our SS16 campaign, shot by Juergen Teller. Earlier this month, Italy’s Culture Minister finally announced a ban on the vessels, following a request from Unesco. The ban makes permanent the current coronavirus-related restrictions on tourist ships, which have been credited with improving the water quality in Venice’s lagoons during the pandemic.
                                In addition to the presentation of Vivienne’s award, Hearst Good Energy Talks featured five-minute talks from  a range of sustainability-focused speakers including explorer Alex Bellini, environmental scientist Maria Sole Bianco, and chef Massimo Bottura.

                                In a special recorded message, Vivienne said “I want to thank you so much for the Good Energy Award for activism. Italy knows me better than anybody because Italian press have supported me up to the hilt and I produce there.”
                                She continued: “I’ve always combined fashion and activism and on the day of my 80th birthday, our Milan team sent me an article of my life in an important newspaper and under which was the news that they will no longer allow cruise ships into Venice, I was so thrilled. So, I am relying on you, Italy, to help me save the world. Stop climate change. Stop War. climaterevolution.co.uk”.

                                The tartan garment we recognise today began to take shape in the late 16th century in the Highlands of Scotland. Men at the time wore something known as a belted plaid — a huge expanse (as much as two yards by six yards) of worsted wool that would be draped over the shoulder and belted around the waist. A hundred or so years later, a more tailored alternative to the bulky belted plaid emerged — the item essentially snipped in two with pleats sewed into the lower portion. Controversially, early accounts credit an Englishman — a Lancastrian Quaker named Rawlinson who owned a Highland smelting works — with this more versatile and work-ready reinvention.

                                Over the past 10 years Artisan.Fashion in Kenya has engaged 28 artisan groups and employed over 2,600 craftsmen with meaningful work and fair pay, 78% of which are women. In Kenya, Vivienne Westwood has worked with various skills and materials such as metalwork from scrap metal, screen-printing, upcycled dhow sails, and many more. Through Artisan.Fashion, artisan communities in Nepal (cashmere weaving), Burkina Faso (cotton weaving) and Mali (natural dyes) have also been able to gain dignified work with a direct impact on their livelihoods. The project has also meant that many rural populations, engaged by EFI, who previously relied on the sale of charcoal and firewood which has a direct consequence on the environment, have been able to support themselves and their families through the programme without having to deplete their natural resources.

                                Through development and education within the programme, many of the artisans involved are now aware of the importance of their natural environment and are involved in activities aimed at improving, restoring or conserving the environment through tree planting and reforestation. The recycling of waste is also a key element to the project with the bag linings made from recycled second-hand clothes known as mitumba, and the hard elements and orb logos featured on the bags created from melted down and recycled metal found in the slums. This design element not only adds to the sustainability of the product, but also sparks education around the importance of recycling and reusing waste.
